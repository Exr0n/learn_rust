# learn_rust

This originally started as a personal project that was soon abandoned, but was revived for helping with vision and localization for FRC. The final project was writing a simple implementation of quick sort, which is now done. This repository will be archived until more [rust bible](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-01-vectors.html) reading is required.
